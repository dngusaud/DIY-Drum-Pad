This is my old DIY drum pad code may be define these as Version one or very primitive codes
So the codes are mainly functional programmig, and the codes got complicated, long and looks ugly. 
So I am moving the entire structure of the code from Fucntional Programming to Object Orientated Programming, since I leanred them freshly from UOA SOFTENG281. 
It may or may not fit to my project but will see.
